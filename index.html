   <p>Welcome! My name is Emily and I created this page to introduce myself. </p>
   <p>I enjoy experimenting with technologies and one of my current goals is get more involved in open-source softwares. I first started to program in my early 20s, learning from online tutorials. I loved it immediately. Eventually, I went back to college to get a computer science degree, which exposed me to so much more. I love probability theory, discrete math, formal logic. But as much as I am interested in theory, I am hoping to build up more practical skills in the next few months.</p>
